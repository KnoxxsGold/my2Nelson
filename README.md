### My favorite Vacation spot is Ely, Minnesota

Every year my family travels up north to **Ely** for a few days to spend time together, swim and fish. It's always nice to escape the Midwest heat up there. We go there every year to see the town's **Blueberry festival**, and it's always a lot of fun.
