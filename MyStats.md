# BRADY NELSON

    <p> My name is Brady, I'm a big fan of gaming, whether it be tabletop games or video games. I'm a big Horror fan in both games, movies and books. My favorite game is The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, my favorite movie is The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, and my favorite book is The House of Leaves. </p>
